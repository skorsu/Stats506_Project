### Introduction
Linear regression has become widely known as a backbone of modern statistics. Even as more complex, "black box"-style machine learning techniques increase in popularity, many statisticians and researchers still fall back on regression for its interpretability and simpleness. However, linear regression relies on a number on assumptions that may not always be true in practice, such as the constant, monotonic linearity of predictor variables in relation to the response. In this guide, we explore the use of splines to help model predictor variables that may have changing relationships across their domain. These techniques help us to match the predictive power seen in some more advanced machine learning algorithms while keeping the benefits gained by using regression. We show examples in three popular statistical modelling languages - python, R, and STATA. 

### Data
In this guide, we will be using the "wage" dataset from the R package ISLR. This data is also used in the book *[insert book name]* This dataset contains wages from 3,000 Mid-Atlantic, male workers, between the years 2003-2009, along with a select number of other personal demographics. We retain the variables for `wage`, `age`, `year`, and `education` for our analysis. Our goal is to examine the relationship between age, year, and education and workers' yearly wage. 

### Method
We will first calculate a simple linear regression as a baseline. We will then implement four different spline-like techniques on the "age" predictor variable: a step function, polynomial regression, basis spline, and natural spline. At each step, we will check for fit quality, noting any potential improvements along the way. We will conclude with a retrospective and summary of what we learned.   

### Core Analysis {.tabset}
#### Python
```{r, eval = FALSE}
"Kyle's Code"
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
"When you want to show only code, but prevent this chunck to run."
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
print("When you want this chunck to run, but don't want to show the code.")
```

#### Stata
Before starting analysis using splines, first look at OLS regression with wage as it relates to age, year, and education. We can run the simple code below to look at this relationship.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
reg wage age year edu
```

Stata will return the following output:

![OLS output for wage ~ age + year + education](/Users/erincikanek/GitHub/Stats506_Project/Stata/stata_reg_output.png)



To see if a non-linear relationship might be present, kernal density, pnorm, and qnorm plots can assit with this: 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
predict r, resid
kdensity r, normal
```

![QNorm Plot](/Users/erincikanek/GitHub/Stats506_Project/Stata/qnorm_reg.jpg)


```{r, eval = FALSE}
"When you want to show only code, but prevent this chunck to run."
```


![Fitted Plot - Linear (red), polynomial (green), and quadratic (yellow) fit](/Users/erincikanek/GitHub/Stats506_Project/Stata/scatter_fit_plots.jpg)

Based on these plots we might be interested in trying to 


```{r, echo = FALSE}
print("When you want this chunck to run, but don't want to show the code.")
```

##### Cubic Polynomial

##### Piecewise Step Function Regression

##### Basis Spline


##### Natural Spline







#### R
The library `splines` is required for implementing splines by using R.
```{r}
library(splines)
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
data <- read.csv("~/GitHub/Stats506_Project/Dataset/data.csv")
```

```{r scatter_wage_age, include = FALSE}
wage_age <- function(line = FALSE, poly = 1, formula_wage_age = y ~ x){
  plot_title <- "Scatter Plot between Wage and Age"
  
  if(poly != 1){
    plot_title <- paste0("Polynomial degree ", poly)
  }
  
  plot_wage_age <- ggplot(data, aes(x = age, y = wage)) + 
    geom_point(color = "darkblue") +
    theme_bw() +
    labs(title = plot_title, x = "Age", y = "Wage")
  
  if(line == TRUE){
    plot_wage_age + 
      geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = formula_wage_age, color = "yellow")
  } else {
    plot_wage_age
  }
}
```

First, considering the linear regression.
```{r}
model <- lm(wage ~ age + education + year, data = data)
summary(model)
```

The $R^2$ is 0.2619, which is pretty low. Consider the scatter plot between 
`Wage` and `Age`.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = fig_s1}
wage_age()
fig_s1 <- paste0("Figure 3.1 Scatter plot between Wage and Age")
```

The scatter plot show that the relationship between these two variables are not linear. Hence, we will try various types of spline.

##### Step Function
Consider applying the step function on `Age`. 
```{r}
model_cut <- lm(wage ~ cut(age, 4) + education + year, data = data)
summary(model_cut)
```

The $R^2$ is 0.2828, which improved from the previous model. The plot below 
is a scatterplot between `Wage` and `Age`, also the yellow line represents 
the step function.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = fig_s2}
wage_age(TRUE, 1, y ~ cut(x,4))
fig_s2 <- paste0("Figure 3.2 Scatter plot between Wage and Age with the
                 step function.")
```

##### Polynomial Regression
Consider the various number for the degree in the polynomial regression. The plots below are the result from the fitting polynomial regression.
```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
degree_poly <- c(2,3,5,20)

for(i in 1:length(degree_poly)){
  poly_d <- degree_poly[i]
  print(wage_age(TRUE, poly_d, y ~ poly(x, poly_d)))
}

```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
poly_r2 <- c()

for(i in 2:20){
  r2_p <-summary(lm(wage ~ poly(age, i) + education + year, 
                   data = data))$r.squared
  poly_r2 <- c(poly_r2, r2_p)
}

poly_r2 <- data.frame(degree = 2:20, R2 = poly_r2)
colnames(poly_r2) <- c("Degree of the age polynomial", "R-Squared")
poly_r2
```

Even the higher degree give the higher $R^2$, the `overfitting` problem may be occured. Hence, polynomial regression with degree 3 would be appropriate.

```{r}
model_poly <- lm(wage ~ poly(age, 3) + education + year, data = data)
summary(model_poly)
```

The $R^2$ is 0.2909, which improved from all previous models.

##### Basis Spline and Natural Spline
For both `Basis Spline` and `Natural Spline`, the number of knots or the degree of freedom need to be specified. One of the method used for specified is performing `K-fold Cross Validation`. In this case, K is equal to 5. For both types of spline, the highest degree of polynomial for age is 3.

  - Basis Spline: df = 4 + knots
  - Natural Spline: df = 2 + knots

```{r k_fold_cv, include = FALSE}
set.seed(1)
data$CV <- sample(rep(1:5, 600))
```

```{r k_fold_plot, include = FALSE}
## Function for calculate and plot
plot_kfold <- function(knots = 1:10, bs = TRUE){
  store_MSE <- c()
  title_plot <- "5-fold cross-validate MSE"
  
  if(bs == TRUE){
    title_plot <- paste0(title_plot, ": Basis Spline")
  } else  {
    title_plot <- paste0(title_plot, ": Natural Spline")
  }
  
  for(i in knots){
    
    MSE <- c()
    
    for(j in 1:5){
      
      ## Split the data
      train_data <- data %>% filter(CV != j)
      validate_data <- data %>% filter(CV == j)
      
      ## Train the model
      if(bs == TRUE){
        model <- lm(wage ~ bs(age, df = 4 + i) + education + year, 
                    data = train_data)
      } else {
        model <- lm(wage ~ ns(age, df = 2 + i) + education + year, 
                    data = train_data)
      }
      
      ## Store the MSE for each validation set
      MSE <- c(MSE, 
               mean((predict(model, validate_data) - validate_data$wage)^2))
      
    }
    
    ## Store the MSE for each knots
    store_MSE <- c(store_MSE, mean(MSE))
  }
  
  ## Create a plot
  dummy_result <- data.frame(knots = as.factor(knots), store_MSE)
  p <- ggplot(dummy_result, aes(x = knots, y = store_MSE, group = 1)) +
    geom_line() +
    geom_point() +
    labs(title = title_plot, x = "Number of knot", y = "MSE") +
    geom_text(aes(label = round(store_MSE,2)), vjust = -1) +
    ylim(min(store_MSE) - 3, max(store_MSE) + 3) +
    theme_bw()
  print(p)
}
```

Consider the MSE for basis spline.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot_kfold()
```

The MSE is lowest when the number of `knot` is equal to 2. Fit the regression with basis spline.

```{r}
model_basis <- lm(wage ~ bs(age, df = 6) + education + year, data = data)
summary(model_basis)
```

The $R^2$ is 0.2923.

Then consider the Natural Spline.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
plot_kfold(bs = FALSE)
```

The MSE is lowest when the number of `knot` is equal to 4. Fit the regression with natural spline.

```{r}
model_natural <- lm(wage ~ ns(age, df = 6) + education + year, data = data)
summary(model_natural)
```

The $R^2$ is 0.2927.
