## Introduction
Linear regression has become widely known as a backbone of modern statistics. 
Even as more complex, "black box"-style machine learning techniques increase in
popularity, many statisticians and researchers still fall back on regression 
for its interpretability and simpleness. However, linear regression relies on a
number on assumptions that may not always be true in practice, such as the 
constant, monotonic linearity of predictor variables in relation to the 
response. In this guide, we explore the use of splines to help model predictor 
variables that may have changing relationships across their domain. These 
techniques help us to match the predictive power seen in some more advanced 
machine learning algorithms while keeping the benefits gained by using 
regression. We show examples in three popular statistical modelling languages 
- python, R, and STATA. 

## Data {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}
In this guide, we will be using the `Wage` dataset from the R package ISLR. 
This data is also used in the book [Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/). This dataset 
contains wages from 3,000 Mid-Atlantic, male workers, between the years 
2003-2009, along with a select number of other personal demographics. We retain
the variables for `wage`, `age`, `year`, and `education` for our analysis. Our 
goal is to examine the relationship between age, year, and education and 
workers' yearly wage. 

Below is a table and plots explaining the variables used in this example.

### Data Structure
| Variables | Role | Type | Explanation |
|---|---|---|---|
|`Wage`| Response | Numerical | Worker's Wage |
|`Age`| Predictor | Numerical | Age of the worker |
|`Year`| Predictor | Numerical | Year when the data was collected |
|`Education`| Predictor | Categorical | The education of that worker |

Table 0.1: Table explain the type, role, along with the explanation for
each variable.

### Plots
![Figure 0.2: Histogram or Bar chart for variables used in the analysis](/Users/kevin/506FA20/Stats506_Project/R/EDA.png)

## Method
We will first calculate a simple linear regression as a baseline. We will then 
implement four different spline-like techniques on the "age" predictor variable
: a step function, polynomial regression, basis spline, and natural spline. At 
each step, we will check for fit quality, noting any potential improvements 
along the way. We will conclude with a retrospective and summary of what we 
learned.

### Stata

Before starting analysis using splines, first look at OLS regression with wage as it relates to age, year, and education. We can run the simple code below to look at this relationship.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
reg wage age year edu
```

Stata will return the following output:
  
  ![OLS output for wage ~ age + year + education](/Users/erincikanek/GitHub/Stats506_Project/Stata/stata_reg_output.png)



To see if a non-linear relationship might be present, kernal density, pnorm, and qnorm plots can assit with this: 
  ```{r, eval = FALSE}
predict r, resid
kdensity r, normal
```

![Kernal Density Plot](/Users/erincikanek/GitHub/Stats506_Project/Stata/kernel_dens_reg.jpg)

![Pnorm Plot](/Users/erincikanek/GitHub/Stats506_Project/Stata/pnorm_reg.jpg)
![QNorm Plot](/Users/erincikanek/GitHub/Stats506_Project/Stata/qnorm_reg.jpg)
After looking at these plots we might consider the different relationships that age may have with wage. We can plot the two-way fit between wage and age, our main variables of interest, to compare a basic linear, polynomial, and quadratic fit.   

```{r, eval = FALSE}
twoway (scatter wage age) (lfit wage age) (fpfit wage age) (qfit wage age)
```


![Fitted Plot - Linear (red), polynomial (green), and quadratic (yellow) fit](/Users/erincikanek/GitHub/Stats506_Project/Stata/scatter_fit_plots.jpg)

Based on these plots we might be interested in trying to fit a cubic polynomial plot next. 



#### Cubic Polynomial

To create a cubic polynomial in stata we can use the `##` command with the `age` variable. The regression is written as before with the addition of a cubic fit:
  
  ```{r, eval = FALSE}
reg wage c.age##c.age##c.age year educ
```

The output in Stat will look like this: 
  
  ![Regression with Cubic polynomial for Age](/Users/erincikanek/GitHub/Stats506_Project/Stata/cubic_polynom.png)


#### Piecewise Step Function Regression

For the piecewise step function, the steps and intercepts in Stata must be determined manually. Based on analysis in `R` we determined that including 6 groups with 5 cutpoints is best. The below code shows how to generate six age categories and their intercepts. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
* generate 6 age variables, one for each bin * 
  * the age varaible does not have decimels * 
  generate age1 = (age - 28.33)
replace age1 = 0 if (age >= 28.33)
  generate age2 = (age-38.66)
replace age2 = 0 if age <28.33 | age > 38.66
generate age3 = (age- 48.99)
replace age3 = 0 if age <38.66 | age >=48.99
generate age4 = (age - 59.33)
replace age4 = 0 if age <48.99 | age >= 59.33 
generate age5 = (age - 69.66)
replace age5= 0 if age < 59.33 | age>=69.66
generate age6 = (age-80)
replace age6 = 0 if age <69.66
* create intercept variables* 
  generate int1 = 1
replace int1 = 0 if age >= 28.33
generate int2 = 1
replace int2 = 0 if age <28.33 | age > 38.66
generate int3 = 1
replace int3 = 0 if age <38.66 | age >=48.99
generate int4 = 1
replace int4 = 0 if age <48.99 | age >= 59.33 
generate int5 = 1
replace int5= 0 if age < 59.33 | age>=69.66
generate int6 = 1
replace int6 = 0 if age <69.66
```

Using these variables we can then compute a step-wise regression. 


```{r, eval = FALSE}
regress wage int1 int2 int3 int4 int5 int6 age1 age2 age3 age4 age5 age6 ///
  year educ, hascons
```


![Step-wise regression for Age with 6 bins](/Users/erincikanek/GitHub/Stats506_Project/Stata/step_wise.png)



After running the regression we can then use the predicted yhats to graph the results: 
  
  ```{r, eval = FALSE}
predict yhat
twoway (scatter wage age, sort) ///
  (line yhat age if age <28.33, sort) ///
  (line yhat age if age >=28.33 & age < 38.66, sort) ///
  (line yhat age if age >=38.66 & age < 48.99, sort) ///
  (line yhat age if age >=48.99 & age<59.33, sort) ///
  (line yhat age if age >=59.33 & age<69.66, sort) ///
  (line yhat age if age >=69.66, sort), xline(28.33 38.66 48.99 59.33 69.66) // this looks awful
```



![Step-wise regression for Age with 6 bins](/Users/erincikanek/GitHub/Stats506_Project/Stata/Step_function.jpg)


#### Basis Spline
For the basis spline, we use the command `bspline`, created by Roger Newson and suggested by [Germán Rodríguez at Princeton] (https://data.princeton.edu/eco572/smoothing2). To create the spline, we call `bspline`, setting the x variable to age and then identifying where we would like the knots in the function. For this example I use 3 knots at 35, 50 and 65, however it should be noted that the min and max of the values need to be included in the knots parentheses. I also use a cubic spline, incidated by `p(3)`. The last step in the line of code is the code that generates the splines for inclusions in the regression. Then the regression can be written as below.    


```{r, eval = FALSE}
bspline, xvar(age) knots(18 35 50 65 80) p(3) gen(_agespt)
regress wage _agespt* year educ, noconstant
```


The output for the regression in Stata is: 
  
  
  ![Basis Spline Regression](/Users/erincikanek/GitHub/Stats506_Project/Stata/spline_reg.png)


To look at the fit for age, we can examine the two-way scatter plot between `wage` and `age` using the predicted values of the bivariate regression with splines. 
```{r, eval = FALSE}
regress wage _agespt*, noconstant
predict agespt
*(option xb assumed; fitted values)
twoway (scatter wage age)(line agespt age, sort), legend(off)  ///
  title(Basis Spline for Age)
```



![Step-wise regression for Age with 6 bins](/Users/erincikanek/GitHub/Stats506_Project/Stata/basis_spline.jpg)


#### Natural Spline
This further extension is still being coded. Please see the README.md file. 


### R
Here is the required `libraries` for this tutorial.
```{r, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse) ## This library is for data manipulation.
library(ggplot2) ## This library is for data visualization.
library(gridExtra) ## This library is also for data visualization.
library(splines) ## This library is for spline.
```

In this example, the author has written two additional functions. All of the 
code for the user-written functions is in `User-written function.R`.

  - `wage_age` This function is for plotting the scatter plot between age and 
  wage, which including the regression line.
  - Another function is `plot_kfold`, which primary for doing the 5-fold cross
  validation to select the degree of freedom for basis and natural spline.
  
<details>
 <summary> `User-written function.R` </summary>
 
```{r, define_path, include = FALSE}
path <- "/Users/kevin/506FA20/Stats506_Project/"
```

```{r user_written_function, include = FALSE}
source(paste0(path, "R/User-written functions.R"))
``` 

```{r User-written function.R, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
readLines(paste0(path, "R/User-written functions.R"))
```
</details>

\
First, read the dataset into R.
```{r read_data, include = FALSE}
data <- read.csv(paste0(path, "Dataset/data.csv"))
```

For the simplicity, the author decided to convert `Education` variable into
numerical variable.

```{r edu_value, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, comment = ""}
edu_val <- data.frame(data %>% 
                        distinct(education) %>% 
                        arrange(education), 
                      1:5)
colnames(edu_val) <- c("Old Value", "New Value")
cap_R1 = "Table 3.1 The converted value of the Education variable."
kable(edu_val, caption = cap_R1)
```

```{r education_convert}
data <- data %>% mutate(edu = ifelse(education == "1. < HS Grad", 1, 
                                     ifelse(education == "2. HS Grad", 2, 
                                            ifelse(education == "3. Some College", 3,
                                                   ifelse(education == "4. College Grad", 4, 5)))))
```

#### Linear regression.
First, consider the linear regression. Below is a model, along with the 
Quantile-Quantile plot.
```{r}
model_lr <- lm(wage ~ age + edu + year, data = data)
summary(model_lr)
```

```{r qq_kernel, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = cap_R2}
cap_R2 <- "Figure 3.2 The QQ plot, along with the Kernel density plot of the 
residual from the linear regression."

set.seed(1) ## For the reproducible plot.

p1 <- data.frame(resi = model_lr$residuals) %>%
  ggplot(aes(sample = resi)) +
  stat_qq(color = "darkblue") +
  stat_qq_line(color = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "The QQ plot of the residuals", 
       x = "Inverse Normal",
       y = "Residuals")

p2 <- data.frame(resi = model_lr$residuals) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = resi)) +
  geom_density(color = "darkblue") +
  geom_density(data = data.frame(resi = rnorm(10000,0,sd(model_lr$residuals))),
               color = "red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(title = "Kernel Density Estimate",
       x = "Residual",
       y = "Density")

grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 2)
```

```{r scatter, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = cap_R3}
wage_age(line = TRUE)
cap_R3 <- paste0("Figure 3.3 Scatter plot between Wage and Age")
```

By considering these plots, the suggestion is that we should try to model 
`Wage` and `Age` with the different relationship.

#### Cubic Polynomial Regression
The first type that we will consider is the `Polynomial Regression`. In order
to use this regression, you have to use `poly()` function in `lm()`. 
```{r poly_reg}
model_poly <- lm(wage ~ poly(age, 3) + edu + year, data = data)
summary(model_poly)
```

```{r cubic_plot, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = cap_R4}
wage_age(line = TRUE, poly = 3, y ~ poly(x,3))
cap_R4 <- paste0("Figure 3.4 Scatter plot between Wage and Age with a line 
                 indicate the cubic polynomial regression")
```

#### Piecewise Linear Regression
```{r step_reg}
model_cut <- lm(wage ~ cut(age, 4) + edu + year, data = data)
summary(model_cut)
```

```{r step_plot, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = fig_R5}
wage_age(TRUE, 1, y ~ cut(x,4)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(33.5, 49, 64.5), color = "red")
fig_R5 <- paste0("Figure 3.5 Scatter plot between Wage and Age with the
                 step function.")
```

#### Basis Spline and Natural Spline
For both `Basis Spline` and `Natural Spline`, the number of knots or the degree
of freedom need to be specified. One of the method used for specified is 
performing `K-fold Cross Validation`. In this case, K is equal to 5. For both 
types of spline, the highest degree of polynomial for age is 3.

  - Basis Spline: df = 4 + knots
  - Natural Spline: df = 2 + knots

```{r k_fold_cv, include = FALSE}
set.seed(1)
data$CV <- sample(rep(1:5, 600))
```

Consider the MSE for basis spline.
```{r basis_MSE, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = cap_R6}
plot_kfold()
cap_R6 <- "Figure 3.6 The MSE of the basis spline from performing 
5-fold cross validation"
```

The MSE is lowest when the number of `knot` is equal to 2. Fit the regression 
with basis spline.

```{r basis_reg}
model_basis <- lm(wage ~ bs(age, df = 6) + edu + year, data = data)
summary(model_basis)
```

Then consider the Natural Spline.
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = cap_R7}
plot_kfold(bs = FALSE)
cap_R7 <- "Figure 3.7 The MSE of the natural spline from performing 
5-fold cross validation"
```

The MSE is lowest when the number of `knot` is equal to 4. Fit the regression 
with natural spline.
```{r}
model_natural <- lm(wage ~ ns(age, df = 6) + education + year, data = data)
summary(model_natural)
```
