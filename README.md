This is a folder for the [Stats 506](https://github.com/jbhender/Stats506_F20) Fall 2020 Midterm Group Project.  

## Proposal
The general topic are we have chosen is regression splines. From our initial research, it seems
that splines can be used as a smoothing technique for a predictor variable. We see potential interest
in exploring splines to account for a predictor variable that has a non-linear relationship with our 
response variable that may change over the domain of the predictor variable.  

We will focus on piecewise step function, basis functions, and piecewise polynomial, cubic and natural spline.
