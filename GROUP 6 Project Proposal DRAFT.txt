GROUP 6 Project Proposal 

Members: Kyle Schulz, Erin Cikanek, Suppapat Korsurat

The general topic are we have chosen is regression splines. From our initial research, it seems
that splines can be used as a smoothing technique for a predictor variable. We see potential interest
in exploring splines to account for a predictor variable that has a non-linear relationship with our 
response variable that may change over the domain of the predictor variable. 

We will be producing a tutorial for this technique in three languages: R, Stata, and Python. Suppapat 
will be doing R, Erin will be taking over Stata, and Kyle will be using Python. 

Our dataset is not yet chosen - we are taking steps now to explore available datasets and determine
which will be the best to use an example for this task.
