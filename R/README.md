## Exploratory Data Analysis
This is the histogram for the response variable.

Also, this is the bar plot for the Region, one of the predictor.

#### Comment
 - Drop `region` out from teh analysis since the value for this variable is the same for the entire dataset.  
 - By considering the histogram of the wage, the response variable, I have eliminated the observations that wage > 200. (99 observations)  
- logwage has the same meaning with wage. I decided to drop it.
