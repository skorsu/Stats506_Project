# Stata Files for Regression Splines

This file contains the Stata code and .dta file to learn about running regression splines in Stata. 

* The original wage data can be found in the 'wage_data.csv' file. 

* The file 'data_cleaning_stata.do' allows for the formating of the csv file for the analysis and produces the 'wage.dta' file. 

* The file 'Cikanek_Stata.do' walks through spline analysis in Stata using the 'wage.dta' file. The file also contains the code to reproduce all Stata regression output and figures that are shown in the final Rmd. 

* All images found in the .Rmd file are in the 'Stata_images' folder.

* The README.md in the 'Stata_images' folder contains more information on each image and figure.
